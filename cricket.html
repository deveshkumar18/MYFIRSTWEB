    <P>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar [sachin tendulkəɾ]; born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team.
        <br><HR>
        He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.
        <br><HR>
        Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years.
        <br><HR>
         In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.
         <br><HR>
          Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.
          <br><HR>
           He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament.Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievements, the Khel Ratna Award, India's highest sporting honour, in 1997, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, two of India's highest civilian awards.
           <br><HR>
           A few hours after the end of his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. As of 2021, he is the youngest recipient to date and was the first sportsperson to receive the award. In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India. In 2010, Time magazine included Tendulkar in its annual Time 100 list as one of the most influential people in the world.Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 ICC Awards.[14] Having retired from ODI cricket in 2012, he retired from all forms of cricket in November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match.Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI compiled in 2013 to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and he was only batsman of post war era along with Viv Richards to get featured in the team.
           <HR>
            <H1>EARLY YEARS</H1>
            <HR>
                <P>Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973 [21] [22][23][24] to a Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin Maharastrian family[25][26][27] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[28] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[29][30]

                    Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[31]
                    
                    He also showed interest in Tennis, idolising John McEnroe. When he was 7 to 8 years, he was a fan of McEnroe and his love for Tennis was on equal level of Cricket, as per him it was time whether I play Tennis or play cricket. That time he had grown long hairs like McEnroe and use to wear wrist bands and head bands like his Tennis hero and use to carry Tennis racket wherever go.[32][33][34]
                    
                    To help curb his mischievous, bullying tendencies, Ajit Tendulkar, his elder brother introduced Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the Sachin did not able to play his best game. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[35][better source needed] Ajit Tendulkar also had experience of playing cricket in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League.[36]
                    
                    Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[22] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[37] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[38] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[39] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[37]
                    
                    
                    Sachin Tendulkar and his wife Anjali
                    Meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield.[40] Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga Cricket League,[37] and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India (CCI).[41] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but the Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[42] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India.[43] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best Junior Cricketer Award" (He was 14 years that time). "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me," Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[44][45] Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[46][47] In his season[clarification needed] in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played.[citation needed] He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[48] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India.[49]</P>

        <H1>Early domestic career</H1>
        <HR>
            <P>On 14 November 1987, the 14-year-old Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[37] He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[37] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at Wankhede stadium and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[50] He was selected to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily playing India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium's Cricket practice nets,[22] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[51]

                Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Ranji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth-highest run-scorer overall.[52] In 1995–96 Irani trophy he captained Mumbai against Rest of India team.[53] He also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.[54] Sachin was picked for a young Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in 1988 and 1989.[55] In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay by two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 balls was a key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[56]
                
                In the final of 1995 Ranji trophy, Tendulkar scored 140 and 139 versus Punjab at Wankhede playing as a captain. Against Haydrabad 53, 128 in 2000, 105, 43 against Bengal in 2007 are the innings he played for Mumbai in the final of Ranji trophy at Wankhede stadium.[53]
                
                His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[22][57] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[58] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.[59][60][61]
                
                Tendulkar was part of 5 Ranji trophy finals in which Mumbai won 4.[53]</P>

                    <H1>Yorkshire</H1>
                    <p>In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from outside Yorkshire.[22][Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.[62]</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>International career</p>
                    Early career
                    Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[63] after one first class season.[64] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[65] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it.[66] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[67] This was later called "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.[68] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.[69][70] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[71][72]
                    
                    The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[73] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[74] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match.[66] Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also wrote:[75]
                    
                    He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen.
                    
                    Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."[76]
                    
                    Rise through the ranks
                    Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. He opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls.[77] He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[78][79] It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.
                    
                    
                    Tendulkar waits at the bowler's end.
                    Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.[80] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[81]
                    
                    After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.[citation needed] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.[82] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.[83]
                    
                    Desert storm
                    
                    Sachin scored 143 (131) runs in Sharjah against mighty Australian team into the 1998 Coca-Cola cup, he smashed 5 sixes, In the inning against Shane Warne, Damien Fleming and Michael Kasprowicz. Per ICC's poll it is the bestest one day inning of him. This inning of Tendulkar's is famous as 'Desert storm', due to this match was interrupted by desert storm.[84]
                    
                    This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a Test series.[85] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[86] In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[87] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[88][89] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs.[90] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah—the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[91] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[92]
                    
                    Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[93]
                    
                    The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[94] In the first match, between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Around 100,000 people came to support India during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record.[95] The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people.[96] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[97] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.[98]
                    
                    In the Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory. However, he was out when India needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12 runs.[99] The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.[100] However, he returned to the World Cup scoring a century (140 not out of 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.[101]
                    
                    <hr>
                    <p>Captaincy</p>
                    Tendulkar's record as captain
                         Matches	Won	Lost	Drawn	Tied	No result	Win %
                    Test[102]	25	4	9	12	0	–	16%
                    ODI[103]	73	23	43	–	2	6	31.50%
                    Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",[104] which translates into: "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!".[105]
                    
                    Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions.[106] Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award[106] as well as player of the match in one of the games.[107] After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000.[108][109]
                    
                    During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. Then Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[110]

                    In the year of 2000 a huge match fixing scandal happened in Indian cricket. After the incident Sachin Tendulkar and other 3 senior cricketers played important role ensured that the players banned by BCCI and whose performance was dubious ware never picked for the Indian team again. Sachin and co. did this work quietly without doing public statements.[111]
                    
                    The continued calls for Tendulkar to be made captain, the offer of captaincy in 2007 and his rejection of the offer, there are numerous articles relating to where his faults were in captaincy.
                    
                    <p>Mike Denness incident</p>
                    Main article: Mike Denness and Indian cricket team incident
                    In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team.[112] Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light of alleged ball tampering. Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball.[113] This can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball. Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one Test match ban.[114] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism,[115] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.[116] The charges against Tendulkar and Sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.[117]
                    
                    Injuries and decline amid surpassing Bradman's haul
                    Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001, including the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test. His three wickets haul helped India win the match.[118] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.[119]
                    
                    In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Sir Donald Bradman's record of 29 Test hundreds. He was gifted a Ferrari 360 Modena by Fiat through Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat.[120][121][122]

                    Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four innings.[123] He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost the series.[124] In this period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin scored his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match.[125][126]

                    Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[127] helping India reach the final. While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[128][129]
                    
                    He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia.[130][131] As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final.[132]

                    The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, scoring 241 not out from 436 balls with 33 fours at a strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spent 613 minutes at the crease during the innings. He followed this up with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.[133] Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests.[citation needed] It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.00 and just one fifty.[134]
                    
                    Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests.[135] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise.[136] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.[137][138] After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.[139]
                    
                    A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004.[140][141] He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1.[142]
                    
                    On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest[needs update] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.[143] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.[144] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[145] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory.[146] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd,[147] the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.[citation needed]
                    
                    Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century.[148] Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.[149]
